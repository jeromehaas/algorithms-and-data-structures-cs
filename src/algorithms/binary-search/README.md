# Binary Search

## Overview
Binary Search efficiently finds a target value within a **sorted** array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## Complexity
| Case    | Time        | Space |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Best    | O(1)        | O(1)  |
| Average | O(log n)    | O(1)  |
| Worst   | O(log n)    | O(1)  |

## When to Use
- Searching in sorted arrays.
- Need O(log n) search performance.
- Not suitable for unsorted data without prior sorting overhead.
