# Bubble Sort

## Overview

Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
This process repeats until no swaps occur.

## Complexity

| Case    | Time  | Space |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Best    | O(n)  | O(1)  |
| Average | O(n²) | O(1)  |
| Worst   | O(n²) | O(1)  |

*Stops early if no swaps in a pass.*

## When to Use

- Small arrays
- Nearly sorted data (adaptive)
- Teaching algorithm basics
